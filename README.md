Amino acid chord rules:

7 categories of amino acids, each category is one chord

Positively charged amino acids: C 
Negatively charged amino acids: D
Hydrophobic: E
Hydrophilic uncharged: F 
Glycine: G 
Proline: A 
Cysteine: B 

Each amino acid in the category getâ€™s chord with different note as root of chord

Lysine: C, arginine : C e lowest, histidine: C g lowest
Glutamate: D, aspartate: D f sharp lowest 
Phenylalanine: E, tyrosine E g# lowest, tryptophan E b lowest, leucine E, isoleucine E g# lowest, alanine E b lowest, valine B, methionine B with g# as lowest
Serine: F, asparagine F with a lowest , glutamine f with c lowest, threonine F
Glycine: G
Proline: A 
Cysteine: B

Categories of amino acids based on unique atoms in side chain functional group:

Oxygen: quarter note
Nitrogen: half note
Sulfur: whole note
Carbon: eighth note
